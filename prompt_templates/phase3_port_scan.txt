### CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES:

1. **USE ONLY PROGRAMMATIC REPORT DATA** - This is your ONLY source
2. **NEVER INVENT CVEs** - If not in data, write "No CVEs detected"
3. **NEVER INVENT VERSIONS** - If not in data, write "Version: Unknown"
4. **NEVER INVENT SERVICES** - Only report what's in the scan
5. **NEVER INVENT PORTS** - If no ports found, say "No open ports detected"
6. **REQUIRE PROOF** - Every finding needs evidence from scan output

Focus on actual scan results. Be specific and evidence-based.
