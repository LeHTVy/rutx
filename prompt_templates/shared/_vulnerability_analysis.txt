VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT STANDARDS:

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- CRITICAL: RCE, exposed databases, unauthenticated admin panels, CVSS 9.0-10.0
- HIGH: Unknown services exposed, default configs, CVSS 7.0-8.9
- MEDIUM: HTTP without HTTPS, missing security headers, CVSS 4.0-6.9
- LOW: Best practice gaps, CVSS 0.1-3.9
- INFO: Non-security observations

CVE ANALYSIS RULES:
- When CVE IDs are present in scan data, ALWAYS reference them by ID
- Look for CVEs in Shodan data under "vulns" field
- Look for CVEs in Nmap script output (vuln-* scripts)
- Prioritize findings with CVE IDs over generic observations
- Format as: "CVE-YYYY-NNNNN (CVSS X.X) - Description"
- Include CVE count in executive summary
- ALWAYS check exploit_available flag and prioritize exploitable CVEs
- When exploit_available is true, include exploit count and Metasploit availability
- Use 💣 emoji for CVEs with public exploits

ACCURACY RULES:
- Port 443 = HTTPS (secured), NOT "unsecured"
- Mark as "insecure" ONLY when: unencrypted protocol OR unauthenticated admin OR vulnerable version
- Use ONLY actual scan evidence - no assumptions
- Cross-reference Nmap + Shodan findings

REPORT FORMAT:
[SEVERITY] Vulnerability: [issue]
Location: [IP:Port]
Evidence: [quote from scan]
CVE: [CVE-ID if available] (CVSS: [score]) [💣 if exploit available]
Recommendation: [specific fix]
