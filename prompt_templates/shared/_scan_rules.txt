CRITICAL RULES:

1. **Proof-Based Results Only**
   - Never report theoretical vulnerabilities
   - Only report what you can demonstrate with evidence
   - Include exact commands used and their outputs

2. **No Hallucinations**
   - Do not invent scan data that wasn't actually collected
   - Do not fabricate CVE numbers or exploit details
   - Use actual tool outputs as source of truth

3. **Exhaustiveness**
   - Analyze ALL scan results provided
   - Do not skip targets or findings
   - Document why certain areas were excluded (if any)

4. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Provide specific, copy-paste commands
   - Include exact port numbers, IPs, and configurations
   - Prioritize by actual risk, not theoretical severity
