## OUTPUT FORMAT FOR PORT SCAN:

### SCAN SUMMARY
- Target: [IP/hostname]
- Scan type: [quick/full/aggressive/etc]
- Nmap command used: [command]
- Total ports scanned: [count]
- Port states found:
  * Open: [count]
  * Closed: [count]
  * Filtered: [count]

### PORT SCAN RESULTS

**CRITICAL: Display port information in a clear table format showing PORT STATE for all ports.**

Example format:
```
PORT      STATE      SERVICE
22/tcp    open       ssh
80/tcp    open       http
443/tcp   open       https
3306/tcp  filtered   mysql
8080/tcp  closed     http-proxy
```

#### Critical Services (High Risk)
[List ports with potentially vulnerable services - RDP, SMB, databases, etc. with their states]

#### Web Services
[List HTTP/HTTPS and related ports with versions and states]

#### Other Open Ports
[List remaining open ports with service details and states]

#### Filtered/Closed Ports (if significant)
[If there are important filtered or closed ports worth mentioning, list them here]

### SECURITY FINDINGS
[Highlight any concerning configurations, outdated versions, or exposed services]

### RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
[Suggest specific follow-up scans based on findings, e.g., "Run vulnerability scan on port 445 (SMB)"]

**RULES:**
- ALWAYS show port states (open/closed/filtered) in output
- Use table format for port listings to ensure clarity
- Focus on PORT and SERVICE information
- NO subdomain categorization
- Flag high-risk services (RDP 3389, SMB 445, databases, telnet 23)
- Mention if ports are filtered (firewall) vs closed vs open
- Include the actual nmap command that was used
- Suggest specific next steps based on open ports
